Overall, lung cancer causes \\nmore deaths than breast, prostate, colorectal, and brain \\ncancers combined [1]. In 2021, an estimated 235,760 \\nnew lung cancer cases will be diagnosed in the US, and \\n131,880 people will die from this disease [2]. Non-small \\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of \\nlung cancer, accounting for more than two-thirds of the \\ncases, with most patients (84%) having advance disease at \\nthe time of diagnosis [3]. Identification of targetable alter -\\nation (i.e., EGFR, ALK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS-MAPK, \\nRET, MET, BRAF, and NTRK/ROS1) in patients with \\nadvanced NSCLC has evolved its treatment paradigm [4]. \\nThe approval and adoption of agents targeting these alter -\\nations has contributed to the decline in incidence-based \\nmortality from 35% among men with NSCLC diagnosed \\nin 2001 to 26% among those diagnosed in 2014. Similar patterns have been found among women with NSCLC \\n[5]. Despite these new therapeutic options for patients \\nwith advanced NSCLC, there continues to be significant \\nchallenges as resistance development and disease pro -\\ngression occurs in most of these patients [6].

In a study, 1144 patients with NSCLC under -\\nwent next generation sequencing for PI3KCA mutations. \\nMutations were identified in 3.7% of the patients [108]. \\nNon-small cell lung squamous cell carcinoma (8.9%) \\nwere more likely to be have these mutations when com -\\npared with adenocarcinoma (2.9%). On the other hand upregulation of mTOR pathway is seen in up to 90% of \\nthe patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma compared to \\n40% of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma [109]. \\nS6K and 4E-BP1 are the downstream products of mTOR \\nactivation. These have also been identified in up to 58% \\nand 25% of NSCLC specimens respectively [110]. It is \\nalso postulated that in patients with an EGFR mutant \\nNSCLC, the AKT/mTOR pathway is constitutively acti -\\nvated in 67% of cases [111].\\nSapanisertib (TAK228) is an oral TORC1/2 inhibitor. In \\na phase II trial with stage IV squamous NSCLC patients, \\nit showed differential activity in NFE2L2 (ORR of 20%) \\nand KEAP1(ORR of 17%) mutant patients [112]. Most \\ncommon AEs included hyperglycemia (72%), fatigue \\n(32%), diarrhea (32%), decreased appetite (32%).\\nSirolimus binds to FKBP-12, an intracellular protein, \\nto form an immunosuppressive complex which inhib -\\nits mTOR [113].

Overall, lung cancer causes \\nmore deaths than breast, prostate, colorectal, and brain \\ncancers combined [1]. In 2021, an estimated 235,760 \\nnew lung cancer cases will be diagnosed in the US, and \\n131,880 people will die from this disease [2]. Non-small \\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of \\nlung cancer, accounting for more than two-thirds of the \\ncases, with most patients (84%) having advance disease at \\nthe time of diagnosis [3]. Identification of targetable alter -\\nation (i.e., EGFR, ALK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS-MAPK, \\nRET, MET, BRAF, and NTRK/ROS1) in patients with \\nadvanced NSCLC has evolved its treatment paradigm [4]. \\nThe approval and adoption of agents targeting these alter -\\nations has contributed to the decline in incidence-based \\nmortality from 35% among men with NSCLC diagnosed \\nin 2001 to 26% among those diagnosed in 2014. Similar patterns have been found among women with NSCLC \\n[5]. Despite these new therapeutic options for patients \\nwith advanced NSCLC, there continues to be significant \\nchallenges as resistance development and disease pro -\\ngression occurs in most of these patients [6]. This has led \\nto research in identifying drugs that can overcome these \\nresistance pathways. Next-generation sequencing, which \\ncan be performed on the tumor tissue and circulating \\ntumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, is now the standard', metadata={'page': 0.0, 'source': '.saved_pdfs/10.1186_s13045-021-01121-2.pdf', 'title': 'targeted therapy advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer current advances future trends'})]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRelevant Documents: 0,1,2\n",
