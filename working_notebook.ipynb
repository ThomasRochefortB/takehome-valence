However, \\nonly limited data exist for patients with cancer under systemic therapy. Based on this, our site has initiated a study \\nevaluating safety and efficacy of SARS‑ CoV‑2 vaccination in patients with solid and hematological malignancies under \\nseveral systemic therapies. The initial results of the cohort of 59 patients receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors are \\npresented here. Despite no new safety issues have been noticed, the levels of SARS‑ CoV‑2 neutralizing antibodies are \\nsignificantly lower in comparison to matched healthy volunteers up to day 22 post the first dose. These results should \\nbe taken into consideration for the patients under treatment.\\nKeywords: SARS‑ CoV‑2, Vaccination, Cancer, Immune checkpoint inhibitors, BNT162b2, AZD1222\\n© The Author(s) 2021.

How -\\never, patients with cancer were excluded from SARS-\\nCoV-2 vaccines registrational trials [2, 3] and we lack \\ndata regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination in \\nthis population. Under this perspective, we undertook \\na large prospective study (NCT04743388) enrolling \\npatients with solid cancers, hematologic malignancies as well as healthy volunteers for the kinetics of anti-\\nSARS-CoV-2 antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination \\n[4]. Herein, we report the development of neutralizing \\nantibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with \\nsolid tumors receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors \\n(ICIs) after the first dose of the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 \\nvaccines. Major inclusion criteria for this cohort of the \\nstudy included: (1) age above 18\\xa0 years; (2) presence of \\nsolid organ malignancies treated with immunotherapy \\nirrespective of the treatment phase; and (3) eligibility for \\nvaccination.\\nThe serum of both patients and controls was collected \\non day 1 prior to vaccination and on day 22. NAbs against \\nSARS-CoV-2 were measured using FDA approved meth -\\nodology (ELISA, cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 NAbs Detection', metadata={'page': 0.0, 'source': '.saved_pdfs/10.1186_s13045-021-01099-x.pdf', 'title': 'Low titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after first vaccination dose in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.'}), Document(page_content='Page 3 of 4\\n Terpos\\xa0et\\xa0al.

All patients and controls provided writ -\\nten informed consent prior enrollment in the study. Base -\\nline demographics, co-morbidities, and the NAb levels \\nwere compared between the 2 groups, Chi-square test \\nfor categorical variables and unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon \\nsigned-rank test (as appropriate) for continuous vari -\\nables. To adjust for potential confounding effects of dif -\\nferences in covariates, we used case–control matching to \\nmatch the two groups for age, gender, and type of vaccine \\nwith the calipmatch command in Stata. All data extrac -\\ntion and analyses were conducted using Stata 16.0 (Stata -\\nCorp 2019, Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College \\nStation, TX: StataCorp LLC). Two-sided p value < 0.05 \\nwas used for statistical significance.\\nStudy population included 59 patients (36 males/23 \\nfemales; median age: 66\\xa0years, IQR 61–76\\xa0years) and 283 \\ncontrols (median age: 64\\xa0years, IQR 59–82\\xa0years, p = 0.75 \\nfor age compared with patients), vaccinated during the \\nsame period. 44/59 patients (74.6%) and 232/283 controls \\n(82%) were vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 \\nor mRNA-1273), while the remaining received the \\nAZD1222 vaccine (p = 0.19). The characteristics of the \\npatients are depicted in Table\\xa0 1. Among patients, 16 had \\nlung cancer, 15 bladder cancer, 11 kidney carcinoma, \\nand the remaining 17 other carcinomas. Most patients \\n(49 patients, 83.0%) received anti-PD1 treatment, while \\n10 (17.0%) received anti-PD-L1 antibodies or immuno -\\ntherapy combination. Comorbidities in the patient group \\nincluded cardiovascular disease in 42.4%, diabetes in \\n20.3%, pulmonary disease in 10.2%.\\nOn D1, two patients (3.4%) and 26 (9.2%) controls had \\nNAb titers of ≥ 30% (positivity cut-off); there was no dif -\\nference regarding the NAb titers between patients and \\ncontrols on D1 (p = 0.35). None of them had a prior his -\\ntory of known COVID-19. After the first vaccine dose, \\non D22, patients had lower NAb titers compared to \\ncontrols: the median NAb inhibition titer was 22% (IQR \\n13.4–30.2%) for patients versus 38% (IQR 23–54%) for \\ncontrols; p < 0.001 (Fig.\\xa0 1). More, specifically, 15 (25%) \\npatients versus 186 (65.7%) controls developed NAb \\ntiters ≥ 30% on D22   ( p\\xa0< \\xa00.001). The respective number \\nof patients and controls who developed NAb titers ≥ 50% \\n(clinically relevant viral inhibition [6]) was 6 (10.7%) and \\n93 (32.9%), respectively (p = 0.01). Of note, none of the \\npatients enrolled had neutropenia or lymphopenia at first \\nvaccination dose (Additional file\\xa01: Table\\xa0S1).\\nRecently, Waissengrin et\\xa0 al. [7] reported the safety \\nresults of BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with cancer \\ntreated with ICIs. We confirm these data in our study \\npopulation; amongst the 59 patients of our department \\nwho received vaccination while on treatment with ICIs, \\nno unexpected adverse events were noted. During the post vaccination follow-up period (median 44\\xa0days, IQR \\n36–67\\xa0days) immunotherapy related adverse events were \\nrecorded in one patent (1.7%). For the first time, we also \\nreport that patients on treatment with ICIs receiving \\nthe first dose of the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines \\ndevelop low titers of NAb against SARS-CoV-2 by day 22. \\nThese results could be attributed to the immunosuppres -\\nsive effect of cancer and/or treatment given and inform \\nregarding the optimal management of these patients at \\nleast until vaccination completion. Further follow-up of \\nthe current study will provide significant data for the effi -\\ncacy of vaccination in cancer patients.Table 1 Characteristics of the patients\\nIQR interquartile range, BMI body mass index, I/O ImmunotherapyCharacteristic Total population\\nMedian (IQR)\\nAge 66 (61–76)\\nBMI 26.1 (23.6–28.3)\\nN (%)\\nSex\\n Male 36 (61.0%)\\n Female 23 (39.0%)\\nType of cancer\\n Lung cancer 16 (27.1%)\\n Bladder cancer 15 (25.4%)\\n Kidney cancer 11 (18.6%)', metadata={'page': 1.0, 'source': '.saved_pdfs/10.1186_s13045-021-01099-x.pdf', 'title': 'Low titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after first vaccination dose in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.'})]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRelevant Documents: 0,1,2\n",
