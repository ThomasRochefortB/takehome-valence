# takehome-valence
I can start tomorrow 



## Installation
```bash
git clone 
cd takehome-valence
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate takehome_valence
```

Setup your API keys in a .env file in the root directory of the project. 
```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=your_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Usage
I went a bit overboard with the project and implemented a few extra features. 

To launch the app, run the following command:
```bash
chainlit run app.py
```
